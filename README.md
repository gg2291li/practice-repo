# Practice

This Repository is used for getting familar with Github, also for storing my personal leetcode answers as I work on them.

My current goal is to do 5-10 questions of easy to medium level questiosn on leetcode. As for the hard ones, if I get stuck too long on those questions, I will either skip then look back later, or check the solution and understand it.
